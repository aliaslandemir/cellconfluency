# Cell Image Analysis Project

## Description
This project analyzes microscopy cell images (brightfield, 10x magnification) to extract cell properties such as perimeter, convexity, and more. The analysis is performed using Python with libraries like OpenCV, scikit-image, and pandas.

## Features
- Cell segmentation using adaptive thresholding and watershed algorithm
- Feature extraction: area, perimeter, convexity, circularity, etc.
- Visualization of segmented cells and feature distributions
- CSV export of analysis results
